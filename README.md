# Minimal OS Memory Manager
### 1. Low-level Memory Management System Implementation
- Developed a sophisticated memory allocation and management system in x86 Assembly that handles dynamic allocation, address tracking, and defragmentation with optimized algorithms for resource efficiency.

### 2. Matrix-based Data Structure Design in Assembly
- Engineered complex data structures including both one-dimensional and two-dimensional implementations for memory blocks in pure Assembly language, demonstrating deep understanding of memory organization and direct hardware interaction.

### 3. Advanced Memory Operations (Defragmentation Algorithm)
- Implemented a custom defragmentation algorithm that reorganizes memory blocks to eliminate fragmentation, showcasing ability to optimize system resources and manage complex memory states through low-level programming.
